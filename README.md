# Practical Python Project 1

This project demonstrates the use of creating a web application with Flask, a Python Framework. 

In this web application, I explore the form submission and the jinja template engine functionalities in the Flask framework to quickly build web applications.

ðŸ‘‰ [Quick Preview](https://practical-python-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

**Home Page**
    - Landing page for the website with form submission for user's to share something about themselves.
    - When the user submits the form, and customized confirmation page is returned to provide the user feedback about the submission.

**Inspiration page**
    - The web application includes a page that displays random inspirational quotes from a JSON file.
        - The quotes is retrieved from the JSON data any time the user clicks on a request link for it.

 
## Technologies Used

- [Shop Homepage](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage)
    - The application uses **Shop Homepage** Bootstrap template from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) to build the front end.

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
    - The project uses **Flask** framework to quickly build a web application with Python.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/)
    - The project uses **Python** to handle server-side scripting to process data.


## Testing

When it comes to testing, the Jinja template engine automatically tests for any errors in web application before rendering HTML documents.
