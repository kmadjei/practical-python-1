# Practical Python Project 1

This project demonstrates the use of creating a web application with Flask, a Python Framework. 

In this web application, I explore the form submission and the jinja template engine functionalities in the Flask framework to quickly build web applications.

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/)
    - The project uses **Python** to add the functionalities required.


## Testing

When it comes to testing, the Jinja template engine automatically tests for any errors in web application before rendering HTML documents.
